Installing Inkcollector
=======================

To install Inkcollector, you can use pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install inkcollector

This will install the latest version of Inkcollector from PyPI.

I strongly recommend that you install Inkcollector in a dedicated virtualenv,
to avoid conflicting with your system packages.
